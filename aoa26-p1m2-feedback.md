# Project 1, Milestone 2 (p1m2) Feedback

This milestone is graded for a **completion grade _by task (section)_**. If you tried to complete the task, even though there are some mistakes, you'll get full credit **for that task**. If a task is obviously incomplete, you'll get a 0. There is no partial credit within a specific task. The checkbox items below are only for feedback; the checkboxes have no relation to your completion grade. **(An unchecked box does not mean you were deducted points for that item.)**

All files must be in the location specified in the assignment's requirements for credit; our grading process cannot reliably locate your work in other locations.

For _some_ assignments, we provide feedback on your milestones to help guide your work for the final submission. **Our feedback is designed to help you learn more;** our feedback is not a "_pre-grade_". This feedback is designed to catch large problems (which we sometimes miss). Regardless of the feedback (or lack of feedback) that you receive, you are responsible for meeting all the project's requirements in your final submission.

## Organization & Navigation

**Grader Instructions:** Grade the design journey using VS Code's "Markdown: Open Preview."

- [x] The **design process** for the content organization and navigation is thoroughly documented.
- [x] Student documents the alternatives considered for the site's organization and navigation (at least 2 iterations of card sorting).
- [x] Student describes their thought process behind content organization and navigation decisions (rationale for each sort).
- [x] Evidence (photos) of physical card sorting is provided.
- [x] Content is well organized for the site's audience.
- [x] The proposed navigation aligns with the selected card sort's groupings.
- [x] Navigation and page "labels" are appropriate for the site's audience.

> **What needs improvement?**
> I would write short paragraph descriptions explaining your thought process for each card sort. Additionally, make sure to justify why the card sort you chose is appropriate for your audience - why is this the best content organization for 'people who want to get to know you'?

**Organization & Navigation: 4 / 4 points** _(no partial credit)_

## Draft Website

**Grader Instructions:** Open the student's submission in **FireFox** as **local HTML file**. The URL bar in Firefox should start with "file:///". (Do not use the VS Code's "Live Preview" server. Why? We want to check that the student is using proper relative URLs.)

**Design:**

- [x] _Design first, then code_ was practiced by the student.
- [x] Coded website is consistent with design journey.

**Content:**

- [x] Sufficient content is provided to meet the scope of the project; website is not "minimal" or sparse.
- [x] Content is complete; no placeholder content.
- [x] Content moved from the "m1-content" folder into website; m1-content folder deleted.

**HTML:**

- [x] Website includes at least 3 HTML pages, but no more than 5 pages.
- [x] All HTML files are located in the root of the repository (no sub-folders!)
- [x] Main/Home page filename is exactly **index.html** (lowercase).
- [x] Navigation is coded according to class best practices (`<nav><ul><li><a>`).
- [x] All included HTML files are reachable; no dead end or broken links.

**Images:**

- [x] Site includes at least 3 local images.
- [x] All resources (i.e. images) use relative URLs. (no hotlinking, no URLs that start with "/")
- [x] All image files are located inside an **images** (lowercase) folder at the root of the repository.
- [x] Images are not "resized" with HTML or CSS.
- [x] Citations: Resources appear to be cited according to course policy.

**Best Practices:**

- [x] All website resources (i.e. images, CSS, etc.) are located _outside_ of the **"design-plan"** folder.
- [x] All website resource (HTML, images, etc.) filenames are all lowercase.
- [x] All website resources are **outside the "design-plan"** folder; The "design-plan" folder is _only_ for the design journey.

> **What needs improvement?**
> Make sure that your html files are at the root of your repository! They are currently nested under the design-plan folder.

> I would revise your nav bar to follow the `<nav><ul><li><a>` format. Each link should be a list element in an unordered list.

> Your site content is a bit sparse. Make sure to add at least 3 images, as this is a requirement for the project. I would also add more text content to your 'home' and 'contact' pages. You could add a headshot, text paragraph about your career interests, images of hobbies, etc.

**Draft Website: 6 / 6 points** _(no partial credit)_

## Overall

- [x] All design journey content is located within the **design-plan** folder.
- [x] All website content is located at the root (or appropriate subfolder) of the repository.

- [x] Student's work appears to be original; no copied code from labs or external sources (except where permitted).

- [x] Student has made good progress on their project.
- [x] Student does not have outstanding issues that will limit our ability to grade their final submission.
    (i.e. missing files, no images in markdown preview, absolute resource URLs, etc.)

> **What did the student do well?**
> Good job on card sorting!

> **Do you have any additional feedback for the student?**
> Be sure to carefully review the checkboxes in this rubric! We grade milestones leniently, but your current project does not meet many of the requirements.
