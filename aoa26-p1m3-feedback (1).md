# Project 1, Milestone 3 (p1m3) Feedback

This milestone is graded for a **completion grade _by task (section)_**. If you tried to complete the task, even though there are some mistakes, you'll get full credit **for that task**. If a task is obviously incomplete, you'll get a 0. There is no partial credit within a specific task. The checkbox items below are only for feedback; the checkboxes have no relation to your completion grade. **(An unchecked box does not mean you were deducted points for that item.)**

All files must be in the location specified in the assignment's requirements for credit; our grading process cannot reliably locate your work in other locations.

For _some_ assignments, we provide feedback on your milestones to help guide your work for the final submission. **Our feedback is designed to help you learn more;** our feedback is not a "_pre-grade_". This feedback is designed to catch large problems (which we sometimes miss). Regardless of the feedback (or lack of feedback) that you receive, you are responsible for meeting all the project's requirements in your final submission.

## Theme Implementation

**Grader Instructions:** Open the student's submission in **FireFox** as **local HTML file**. The URL bar in Firefox should start with "file:///". (Do not use the VS Code's "Live Preview" server. Why? We want to check that the student is using proper relative URLs.)

**Design:**

- [x] Coded website theme is consistent with the design journey.
- [x] Theme appears to be appropriate for the site's audience.
- [x] Theme is usable; text is readable, sufficient foreground and background color contrast, etc.
- [x] Theme makes effective use of color, shape, typography, and imagery to invoke emotion in their site's audience.

**CSS:**

**Grader Instructions:** Search all HTML files for "style". Check that no `<style>` tags or `style=` attributes are used.

- [x] The site's CSS file is located inside a **styles** (lowercase) folder.
- [x] Only one CSS file (i.e. site.css) exists, and it is used to style every HTML page.
- [x] Only external styling is used. No internal (`<style>`) or inline (`style=""`) styling permitted.
- [x] All font properties fallback to generic font families.
- [x] No hotlinked fonts (No Google Fonts).

_Best Practices:_

- [x] CSS is well-structured and validates.
- [x] CSS code is readable and well formatted.

> **What needs improvement?**
