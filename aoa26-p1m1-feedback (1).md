# Project 1, Milestone 1 (p1m1) Feedback

This milestone is graded for a **completion grade _by task (section)_**. If you tried to complete the task, even though there are some mistakes, you'll get full credit **for that task**. If a task is obviously incomplete, you'll get a 0. There is no partial credit within a specific task. The checkbox items below are only for feedback; the checkboxes have no relation to your completion grade. **(An unchecked box does not mean you were deducted points for that item.)**

All files must be in the location specified in the assignment's requirements for credit; our grading process cannot reliably locate your work in other locations.

For _some_ assignments, we provide feedback on your milestones to help guide your work for the final submission. **Our feedback is designed to help you learn more;** our feedback is not a "_pre-grade_". This feedback is designed to catch large problems (which we sometimes miss). Regardless of the feedback (or lack of feedback) that you receive, you are responsible for meeting all the project's requirements in your final submission.

## Draft Home Page (index.html)

**Grader Instructions:** Open index.html in VS Code's "Live Preview: Show Preview (Internal Browser)." Validate in VS Code by saving the file and view the "Problems" tab.

- [ ] Home page is included as **index.html** (case-sensitive) at the root of the repository.
- [ ] **index.html** includes content that likely addresses the primary goal of the site's audience. (Homepage content is not "minimal.")

- [x] HTML structures the content and provides semantic meaning. HTML is not used for formatting/styling (i.e. `<br/>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, etc.)

- [x] HTML code validates with no errors. Warnings are okay.
- [x] Code is easily readable and well formatted (i.e. properly indented, etc.)

> **What needs improvement?**
> * Your `index.html` file is currently in your `m1-content` folder. Please move `index.html` into the root of your repository.
> * Currently, your `index.html` content is extremely sparse. Please add more before submitting.
