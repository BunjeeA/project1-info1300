        <dt>Monster Legends App</dt>
        <dd>Monster Legends is one of my favorite mobile games. You can collect, breed, train and
            fight with a wide variety of monsters. In Android Studio, I used Java to sort those monsters by element
            and provide basic information about them. To add a fun aspect, I included a quiz to test the user on
            their knowledge of the game.</dd>

        <dt>Word Stacker</dt>
        <dd>Word Stacker is an interactive dictionary/thesaurus. You can search words to see
            definition, part of speech, related words, etc or you can choose to see random words. You can save some
            of the words you come across to your profile and study them later. I came us with this idea as a
            supplement to my vocabulary. I am not the strongest writer and I find myself sometimes either not
            knowing what word to use or using words that I do not completely understand. The programs we use in
            school are forced on us and feel like busy work. However, with Word Stacker, you can take control over
            your own education and vocabulary. I created this web app using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</dd>

    <dl>
        <dt>Histourism</dt>
        <dd>Histourism is a website that strategically combines history and tourism. Various
        people in many different communities, especially as tourists, are uninformed about the culture and
        history behind the places they are going to visit. Our website is able to give the user information
        based on their desired travel location such as historical context, flight plans and more. My group and I
        used HTML, CSS, and Javascript in addition to the Google Maps API and the Skyscanner Flight Search API.</dd>
